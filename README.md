# KOKODA - GRUJIC simple application for tracking egg orders in Clojure
This is a simple web application, created for the needs of my dear father, written in Clojure.

# Where did the initial idea come from?

After completing my undergraduate studies at the Faculty of Organizational Sciences, I decided to step out of my comfort zone and feel the challenge of programming on real problems, and thus acquire a new problem-solving skill.Therefore, my new learning journey began with the Master's program in Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence.Is there a better way to learn programming than to encounter a new, a little bit exotic programming language. Of course, we're talking about Clojure, a dynamic and functional dialect of the Lisp programming language on the Java platform.
This months-long journey was not easy at all, it required a lot of surfing trought the Internet and searching for useful literature, good video material and examples of useful projects,but the most demanding of all was adapting to the logic of the language, which I have never experienced before.
Through the mentioned application, I tried to demonstrate acquired knowledge, so far. At the beginning, I faced the first, and also the most demanding client in my novice career, my dad. Considering that he does not understand programming, many requests were very creative but somewhat unrealistic. In the end we still managed to find a middle ground, and that's how KOKODA - GRUJIC application was born.

I will try to bring you closer to my dad's way of doing business, for whose needs the application was made.....

# App features

The application is divided into two parts, part for admin and part for users. 
The administrator can log in with his credentials, and when he passes the check, he can access the following pages: Porucivanje jaja (Ordering eggs) and Porucivanje hrane (Ordering food). Within the Porucivanje jaja (Ordering eggs) page there is an Sve porudzbine (All orders) tab, where by clicking on it, all orders that have ever been made are listed. By clicking on the desired order, the details of the order are displayed (orderer name, city part, street, amount, price, orderer phone, do date, is order delivered..) and the option to change the order directly, if, for example, it has been delivered. By clicking on Neisporucene porudzbine (Undelivered orders), all parts of the city are listed, and by selecting a part of the city, you can see undelivered orders for that part of the city. Clicking on the Izmeni porudzbinu (Edit order) tab displays the list of orders available for modification, and the Obrisi porudzbinu (Delete order) tab displays the list of orders available for deletion. By clicking on the Porucioci (Customers) tab, the names of all customers are displayed, and by clicking on the customer's name, all his orders are attached. Ordering statistics and cost per person are displayed on the  Statisticki izvestaj (Statistical report) tab.
By clicking on the  Porucivanje hrane (Food ordering) tab (which is designed as a personal diary of the administrator's food orders for laying hens), the administrator can visit the following tabs: Porudzbine hrane (Food orders), which lists the months of the year, and by clicking on the desired month, the dates and quantity for ordered food are displayed (the amount of food ordered is fixed at 1000 kg by default), Kreiraj novu porudzbinu (Create new order) in which the admin can specify the date, month and type of food he ordered, on the delete order admin can delete the information about the order, on the tab Porucena hrana (Ordered food) admin can select the type of food for which he wants to view all orders, and on the Statisticki izvestaj (Statistics report) tab he can view detailed statistics of food orders and monthly cost.


A new user must create an account first, by clicking on the Registruj se (Register) tab, where he enters the name and surname of the owner of the company for which eggs are ordered, a phone number in a certain format (it is assumed that each person has the same phone number, and that it is not possible to create multiple accounts for the same phone number) and password. After successful registration, the user is redirected to the Prijava (Login) page where he needs to confirm used phone number (same format as when registarting) and password. After successfully logging in, the user on the Porucivanje jaja (Ordering eggs) tab makes his new order, where he enters the name of his company or his full name, date, part of the city and street where the order should be delivered, selects the number of pieces of eggs, and enters his phone number, in the same format as when registrating/logging in (this is just another form of verification). Administrator will be abled to see this new order.

# Testing

# Problems I ran into
prvo post metoda, onda kako sam htela da se interaktivno unosi ime kupca i tako da izlaze njegove porudzbine, kako dodati posebnu sesiju za usera, bacanje exceptiona kod registrovanja i logovanja, kako staviti datume, kako staviti validacije da su stvarno uneti datumi, za check box kako sam zakucala 1000kg i za pakete koji se uzimaju iz padajuce liste a u bazi je fiksiran broj jer nisam znala kako da kastujem txt broj sa forme u number itd itd, problem za ukljucivanje midjea, problem za vs code, da nisam znala kako da sredim navbar i da napravim vise razmaka, da nisam znala kako da postavim pozadinu, da sam koristila selmer jer nije htelo da mi renderuje stranicu, i idalje nece sa pozadinom, pomenuti da sam uvidela da sam mogla bolje da napravim arhitekturu aplikacije a to sam videla tek kad sam pogledala onu knjigu..

# What next?
koji sve propusti bi trebalo da budu reseni, a to su ovi gore pomenuti...
